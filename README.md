# Nano-analyzer

**A minimal LLM-powered zero-day vulnerability scanner by [AISLE](https://aisle.com).**

> **Research prototype for demonstration purposes.** This is a simple, single-file harness that is able to detect real zero-day vulnerabilities. Note that it is a prototype, biased towards C/C++ memory safety bugs, and will produce false positives. We are sharing it as-is in the spirit of open research — expect sharp corners.

## What it does

Nano-analyzer is a simple single-file Python scanner that sends source code through a three-stage LLM pipeline:

1. **Context generation** — a model writes a security briefing about the file: what it does, where untrusted data flows, which buffers exist and how big they are.
2. **Vulnerability scan** — the same model, primed with the context, hunts for zero-day bugs function by function and outputs structured findings.
3. **Skeptical triage** — each finding is challenged over multiple rounds by a skeptical reviewer that can grep the codebase to verify (or refute) defenses. An arbiter makes the final call.

Results are saved as Markdown and JSON files for human review.

## Current limitations

This is a v0.1 prototype. Please keep the following in mind:

- **C/C++ bias.** The prompts, few-shot examples, and heuristics are heavily tuned for C/C++ memory safety vulnerabilities (buffer overflows, NULL derefs, integer overflows, type confusion). It will scan other languages but is much less effective there.
- **False positives.** Even with multi-round triage, expect findings that don't hold up on closer inspection. Always verify manually.
- **False negatives.** The scanner can miss entire vulnerability classes — logic bugs, race conditions, cryptographic issues, authentication bypasses, etc. A clean scan does not mean the code is safe.
- **Single-file analysis.** Each file is scanned independently. Cross-file vulnerabilities that depend on interactions between compilation units will likely be missed.
- **LLM-dependent.** Results vary with the model used. Different models will find different things and hallucinate different false positives.

## Setup

### Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- An OpenAI API key (for OpenAI models) or an OpenRouter API key (for other providers)
- Optional: [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) (`rg`) for triage grep lookups
- Optional: [Google codesearch](https://github.com/google/codesearch) (`csearch`/`cindex`) for faster grep on large repos

### Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/weareaisle/nano-analyzer.git
cd nano-analyzer
# No dependency installation needed. Run directly:
python3 scan.py --help
```

### API keys

Set your API key as an environment variable:

```bash
# For OpenAI models (model names without a slash, e.g. "gpt-5.4-nano"):
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

# For OpenRouter models (model names with a slash, e.g. "qwen/qwen3-32b"):
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-...
```

The scanner determines which key to use based on the model name: if it contains a `/`, it routes through OpenRouter; otherwise it uses the OpenAI API directly.

## Usage

### Basic scan

```bash
# Scan a single file
python3 scan.py ./path/to/file.c

# Scan a directory recursively
python3 scan.py ./path/to/src/
```

### Common options

```bash
# Use a different model
python3 scan.py ./src --model gpt-5.4

# Control parallelism
python3 scan.py ./src --parallel 30

# Point triage grep at the full repo root (useful when scanning a subdirectory)
python3 scan.py ./lib/crypto/ --repo-dir ./

# Only surface high-confidence findings
python3 scan.py ./src --min-confidence 0.7

# More triage rounds for higher accuracy (default: 5)
python3 scan.py ./src --triage-rounds 7
```

## How triage works

When a scan finds a medium-or-above severity issue, the triage pipeline kicks in:

1. A skeptical reviewer examines the finding against the actual code and can **grep the codebase** to verify or refute claimed defenses.
2. This repeats for multiple rounds (default: 5), with each reviewer seeing prior arguments and encouraged to find _new_ evidence rather than rehash old points.
3. A final **arbiter** reads all rounds and makes a VALID/INVALID call.
4. The confidence score (e.g. 80% \[VVIVV→V\]) reflects the fraction of rounds that said VALID.

Findings that survive triage are written to the `findings/` directory with full reasoning chains.
